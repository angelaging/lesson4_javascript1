### Project Description:
(In this assignment, I build additional categories into a calculator in order to 
accomodate any additional expenses the user may have. I used previous code as a 
base for the new sections and built upon the original calculator. In turn, 
making a more useful and detailed calculator.)

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (From the best practices for Java script video, I learned that it is very important to format your code in a readable format because it is easier to spot a mistake and it is easier for other programmers to read and build on your code. This also applies to adding comments because it will help remind yourself what each section means, especially if you have to show it to someone else later on.)
2. (I never realized that javascript had an automatic semi colon insertion. This is incredibly useful because this is where a lot of errors stem from. However, I am glad that I took note of this because if it automatically adds a semi colon where it is not supposed to be, I am aware of this automatic trick so I can make sure to delete it if it is not necessary.)
3. (I learned how to utilize Google Developer Tools to find out what was wrong in my code. When I previewed my calculator, I was having an issue with one of my calculations. I was able to use Google Developer Tools in order to find where the issue was and make th correction. This saved me a lot of time and frustration because I was struggling to find which aspect of my code and calculations was wrong.)
